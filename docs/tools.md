# Tools Reference

Complete reference for all tools provided by RE-MCP. Both backends (IDA and Ghidra) share a common set of core analysis tools with the same names, parameters, and response shapes. Each backend also has tools for platform-specific features. Tools that are backend-specific are marked with (IDA) or (Ghidra).

## Tool Discovery

To keep token usage manageable, only common analysis tools and management tools are directly visible to clients. Five meta-tools handle discovery and batching of the full catalog:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_tools` | Search for non-pinned tools by regex pattern (matched against names, descriptions, and tags). Use `.*` to list all hidden tools. Pinned tools are already visible in the tool listing. |
| `get_schema` | Get parameter schemas and return shapes for specific tools by name. Pass `detail="full"` for complete JSON schemas. Works for both pinned and hidden tools. |
| `call` | Lightweight proxy for calling any tool by name, including hidden tools not in the client tool list. |
| `execute` | Execute sandboxed Python code that chains multiple `await invoke(name, params)` invocations in a single round trip. Supports `asyncio.gather` for parallel queries, loops, and result processing between calls. |
| `batch` | Execute multiple tool calls sequentially in a single request (max 50). Collects per-item results and errors. Use for applying the same operation to many targets or mixing different operations without per-call round-trip overhead. |

Tools not in the pinned set are hidden from the listing but callable via `call`, `batch`, or `execute`.

## Conventions

**Addresses** can be specified as hex strings (`"0x401000"`), decimal (`"4198400"`), symbol names (`"main"`), or bare hex (`"4010a0"` — used as a last resort when the string is not a known symbol). Prefer the `0x` prefix for unambiguous hex.

**Pagination** — tools that return lists accept `offset` (default 0) and `limit` (default 100; some tools default to 50 or 20) parameters, and return `items`, `total`, `offset`, `limit`, and `has_more` fields.

**Multi-database** — all tools except management tools (`open_database`, `close_database`, `save_database`, `list_databases`, `wait_for_analysis`, `list_targets`) require the `database` parameter (the stem ID returned by `open_database` or `list_databases`).

**Errors** — tools raise a `BackendError` subclass (`IDAError` or `GhidraError`) on failure. FastMCP catches this and returns `isError=True` with a JSON text body containing `error`, `error_type`, and optional detail fields (e.g. `available_variables`, `valid_types`).

**Old values** — mutation tools return the previous state of modified items (e.g. `old_comment`, `old_type`, `old_bytes`, `old_flags`) alongside the new values, enabling undo tracking and change verification.

## Database

Core database lifecycle management.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `open_database` | Open a binary file or existing database for analysis. Must be called before any analysis tool. By default, previously opened databases from this session remain open; pass `keep_open=False` to save and close databases owned by the current session first. Use `database_id` to assign a custom identifier. Returns immediately — the database is not ready for tool calls until `wait_for_analysis` returns. `wait_for_analysis` runs auto-analysis once if it has not run yet, regardless of `run_auto_analysis`; `run_auto_analysis=True` only starts that pass in the background right after opening. A database that was already analyzed when opened (a saved Ghidra project or an existing IDA database) is reported with `analyzed=True` and is not re-analyzed; call `analyze_database` to force a pass. Pass `force_new=True` to delete any existing database files and start fresh (destructive). **IDA-specific:** `processor`, `loader`, `base_address`, `options` override auto-detection for raw binaries; `fat_arch` selects a Mach-O universal slice. **Ghidra-specific:** `language` and `compiler_spec` override auto-detection. If the project exists but contains no program (e.g. the previous session closed without saving), the binary is re-imported into the existing project. See `list_targets` for available options. |
| `close_database` | Close a database, optionally saving changes. When other sessions are still attached, detaches the current session and keeps the worker alive. Use `force=True` to close regardless of other sessions. If the worker's save or close fails, the response still has `status: closed` (the worker is gone) but includes `close_error` with the worker's error message and, when the worker reported one, `close_error_type` (e.g. `CloseFailed`); treat that as a possible loss of unsaved changes. |
| `save_database` | Save a database without closing it. Fails if the database is not attached to the current session unless `force=True`. |
| `list_databases` | List all currently open databases with metadata (file path, processor, bitness, etc.). Includes `opening` and `analyzing` flags for databases that are still loading or being analyzed. |
| `get_database_info` | Get metadata: file path, processor, bitness, file type, address range, counts. |
| `get_database_paths` | Get file paths associated with current database (IDA). |
| `get_database_flags` | Get database flags (IDA). |
| `set_database_flag` | Set or clear a database flag (IDA). |
| `flush_buffers` | Flush internal buffers to disk (IDA). |
| `get_fileregion_ea` | Map a file offset to a virtual address (IDA). |
| `get_fileregion_offset` | Map a virtual address to a file offset (IDA). |
| `get_elf_debug_file_directory` | Get the ELF debug file directory path (IDA). |
| `reload_file` | Reload byte values from the input file (IDA). |
| `wait_for_analysis` | Wait for one or more databases to finish opening, run auto-analysis once if it has not run yet, and block until the database is ready for tool calls. The first call on a freshly opened database therefore takes as long as analysis; other tools on that database are rejected while it runs. Already-analyzed databases (`analyzed=True` in `list_databases`) return immediately without re-analysis; use `analyze_database` to force a pass. Call this after `open_database`. Pass `databases` (a list) to wait for several at once — returns as soon as at least one is ready. |
| `list_targets` | List available processor modules, loaders, and language/compiler options. Returns names that can be passed to `open_database`. |
